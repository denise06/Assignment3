# Minime! 

## PROJECT  3 :   Full Stack Web Development Project

Minime is an ecommerce store where interested buyers can purchase quality toys/apparels for your little ones at a discounted price. Interested parents can even trade in their products by following the step by step guide on our website.
This idea stems from the amount of waste generated by parents where used toys of good conditions are either thrown away or passed down to people who doesn't really need them. With the use of Minime, we are able to ensure that baby/toddler's toys will not go to waste, and also cultivate a sharing culture among the young parents.
