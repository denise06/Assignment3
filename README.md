# Minime! 

## PROJECT  3 :   Full Stack Web Development Project

Minime is an ecommerce store where interested buyers can purchase quality toys/apparels for your little ones at a discounted price. Interested parents can even trade in their products by following the step by step guide on our website.
This idea stems from the amount of waste generated by parents where used toys of good conditions are either thrown away or passed down to people who doesn't really need them. With the use of Minime, we are able to ensure that baby/toddler's toys will not go to waste, and also cultivate a sharing culture among the young parents. 



## FEATURES 
The website plans to have the following features.

_Basic_
- A welcome homepage to give a brief introduction of Minime and the trade in option
- A detailed trade in page to share more on the steps to take for parents to trade in their toys/apparels 
- An overview page of all the listing as well as quick search functions for buyers to filter the items
- An item detail page to view more information about the listing
- Registered buyers are able to login and add items to their cart as well as checkout using Stripe payment
- Admin person using the role of a "seller" is able to create, update and delete a listing, but they are unable to purchase/checkout.
- Sellers are able to view all the orders placed by buyers and is able to update the status of an order once fulfilled or even delete an order
- A superadmin account using the role of "superaccount" is able to have all the buttons, including checkout, create, update, delete of an item as well as shop management functionalities like updating order status or deleting of orders.

_Advance (current version will not have any development for this level)_

## UI/UX


The navigation bar is responsive for small, medium and large screens based on Bootstrap's breakpoints. 

Design was kept to a simple black and white with blue and red action buttons to clearly display the actions that sellers can take. Listings are displayed using a simple table format which gives it a clean look. 

Adding new items can be found at the top navigation panel. Upon clicking, the form displays a clear and intuitive inpur format with the use of checkboxes, drop downs, text input and radio buttons. 

The main highlight of the App is the 3 quick search inputs which helps to filter the long item listings based on the Shop Name, Item Name, Item Description. This client site serching greatly enhances the buyer's UX as they navigate their way through the plethora of listings. This greatly reduces the need for buyers to search on numerous instagram pages or websites to find the contact info of a home bakers. 

To sellers, they no longer need to fret about the cost of curating their own personal business website to showcase their talents. With the use of this one stop platform, Paradise Bakers helps them publicise and bring them closer to interested buyers. Paradise Bakers also allows sellers to see what their close competitors are doing, providing a level playing field.
